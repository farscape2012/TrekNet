# If you want to avoid typing sudo whenever you run the docker command, add your username to the docker group:
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}

#You will be prompted to enter your user's password to continue. Afterwards, you can confirm that your user is now added to the docker group by typing:
id -nG

# add a user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker username

# Example
# download and run "hello word" example
docker run hello-world

docker search ubuntu

# As an example, let's run a container using the latest image of Ubuntu. 
# The combination of the -i and -t switches gives you interactive shell access into the container:
docker run -it ubuntu

root@f3c33fjeiw3:/#      # inside docker

# delete all docker containers
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

# delete docker a image
docker rmi ubuntu #(repository name)

# apt-get install -y ** does not work as there is no package cache in the image, you need to run:
apt-get -qq update
